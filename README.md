## ETL Project — Milestone-Based Design

This project is part of a structured milestone-based submission and welcomes feedback or extension ideas!

This repository showcases the documentation and logical breakdown of an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline developed through **8 structured milestones**. Each milestone focuses on a core part of the ETL life cycle, simulating a real-world modular data engineering project.

---

## Project Purpose

The project outlines a simplified ETL framework that can be adapted into any data pipeline involving:
- Extracting raw data from a source
- Applying transformations and cleaning
- Loading it into a destination (database, data warehouse, or flat file)

The milestone approach was designed to simulate a real-world SDLC process using clear planning and documentation techniques.

## Milestones Overview

### **Milestone 1: Introduction & Project Scope**
- Defines the purpose of the ETL pipeline
- Lists objectives, tools, and technologies to be used
- Identifies data sources (e.g., CSV, JSON, APIs, or DBs)

###  **Milestone 2: Extract Phase**
- Explains how raw data will be collected from the source system
- Describes data formats, volumes, and extraction schedule
- Covers connection details, security, and error handling in extraction

### **Milestone 3: Data Cleaning**
- Discusses strategies to clean raw data:
  - Removing duplicates
  - Handling null/missing values
  - Data type conversions
- Explains tool/language choices (e.g., Python, Pandas)

### **Milestone 4: Transform Logic**
- Focuses on transformation techniques:
  - Standardization
  - Aggregation
  - Filtering or pivoting
- Includes mapping logic and any business rules applied

### **Milestone 5: Load Phase**
- Describes where and how the processed data will be loaded:
  - Target system (e.g., SQL DB, Data Lake)
  - Load method (batch, incremental)
  - Error handling and logging

###  **Milestone 6: Automation Strategy**
- Proposes automation techniques:
  - Cron jobs
  - Airflow scheduling
  - Python scripts or shell automation
- Discusses retry mechanisms and notification alerts

### **Milestone 7: Testing & Validation**
- QA processes for verifying pipeline integrity:
  - Unit tests on transformations
  - End-to-end testing
  - Sample outputs vs expected results
- Logging and exception handling plan

### **Milestone 8: Scalability & Enhancements**
- Lists future improvements:
  - Cloud integration
  - Big Data pipeline compatibility
  - Monitoring and performance tuning
- Final summary and learnings from the project

## Tech Stack (Planned/Used)
- **Languages**: Python (Pandas), Shell scripting
- **Tools**: Git, VS Code
- **Data**: Flat files (CSV/JSON), SQL DB (optional)
- **Automation**: Cron or Airflow (optional extension)

> “Data is only valuable when transformed into knowledge — this project walks through that journey.”
